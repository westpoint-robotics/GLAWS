1. Assemble the Zumo robot and Pixycam based on their documentation.

2. Use two sets of stackable Arduino headers (or 2.54mm female headers with leads of comparable length) and do the following:

	a) Remove the following four header pins from *both* of the 1x10 header pin: D7, D8, D9, D10

	b) Solder one set of the header pins to the Arduino USB shield. Once you're done, do the following:

		i) Solder jumper wires to the USB shield (e.g. 30 AWG wire) that make the following three connections: RST<-->D7, D2<-->D9, D4<-->D10

		ii) Modify Line 58 of UsbCore.h to use pins D2 and D4 by changing the typedef command to be: typedef MAX3421e<P4, P2> MAX3421E;

	c) Solder header pins onto the Zumo PCB for the following four pins: D7, D8, D9, D10

3. Final Assembly of the robot:
	a) Attach the non-soldered header pins to the Zumo PCB.

	b) Attach the Arduino USB shield to the non-soldered header pins so that you have enough clearance to mount the Bluetooth Dongle into the USB Shield.

	c) Insert the Bluetooth dongle into the USB Shield. You can pair the PS4 controller with the Bluetooth Dongle by using the PS4BT example sketch.

	d) Insert the Arduino Uno into the USB Shield.

	e) Jump pins D7, D8, D9, D10 from the Arduino to the header pins on the Zumo PCB.
